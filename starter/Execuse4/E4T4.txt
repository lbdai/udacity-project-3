
# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
move to private subnet and create a rule that any ssh to instances should be done through AWS Systems Manager, which removes all external access to the instances.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
using a private VPC endpoint does not prevent unauthorized access to the S3 secrets bucket.
The access control for S3 buckets is primarily governed by IAM policies
The VPC endpoint restricts the exposure of your S3 traffic to the internal AWS network

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
only new data will be encrypted, for old data will not be encrypted

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
All of configurations done directly through the AWS management console for the original cloud configuration will be reset.
