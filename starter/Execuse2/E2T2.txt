Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Server-side encryption and logging not enabled for buckets
 remediate the vulnerability:  update the bucket policy to enforce encryption. Turn on VPC Flow Logs to monitor the network traffic in and out of your VPCs.

2. Reconfigure the Application Load Balancer:
 remediate the vulnerability:  Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS

3. Default Security Group Settings: 
 remediate the vulnerability: Modify the inbound, and outbound security group for every VPC to deny all allow necessary outbound traffic. build security group rules that adhere to the principle of least privilege

4. EBS Encryption isn't enabled: 
 remediate the vulnerability: enable encryption to protect data at rest
